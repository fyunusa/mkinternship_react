# day_4

Based on day 3 work, make the ui save the settings for the question type.

based on wireframe.png make the ui ONLY the same except:

- The Question tab, the form input is question, answers(if applicable by question type), required

Logic:

- on clicking Plus icon, it open modal to choose question type, add question to left panel bar at end
- on click of question, shows the question preview in middle of screen
- on right panel input boxes to edit all the options
- on type, update react context to save updates
- on click publish, save to json file
- json file is what you would load into main.js for day 3 to work off of
- result tab will preview it as if live
- the profile icon on right corner has dropdown for logout

This need to be completed at end of day.
